<section>At his boldest, Howy states that the prediction error minimization framework can give us the answer.</section>   
    
    
<section><h2>Prediction error minimization framework?</h2>  <p class="fragment"> "It is the theory that the brain is a sophisticated hypothesis-testing mechanism, which is constantly involved in minimizing the error of its predictions of the sensory input it receives from the world. This mechanism is meant to explain perception and action and everything mental in between. It is an attractive theory because powerful theoretical arguments support it. It is also attractive because more and more empirical evidence is beginning to point in its favour. It has enormous unifying power and yet it can explain in detail too." (Howhy 2013, 1)</p></section>    
    
    
<section><h2>Prediction error minimization framework (PEM)</h2>  The hypothesis that the brain minimizes prediction error.  
    <p class="fragment"> Prediction error: actual sensory input - predicted sensory input</p>
 <p class="fragment"> Prediction error minimization: Prediction error is computed across diferent levels of processing and used to update the model and generate better predictions. Crucially, the cycle of computing estimates, predictions and prediction errors, and updating estimates accordingly is carried out at all levels of a processing hierarchy.</p>    </section>

    <section>But wait, there is more.    <span class="fragment">Hohwy claims that “the idea that the brain minimizes its prediction error [...] explains not just that we perceive but how we perceive: the idea applies <span class="fragment highlight-red">directly</span> to key aspects of the <span class="fragment highlight-red">phenomenology of perception.</span>” (2013, 1).</span></section>   
    
<section>Qualification: PEM gives us constraints: we have not yet a complete PP model -it is more of a general framework; and neither do we have an uncontroversial phenomenological description of perception. But the idea is that on the basis of PEM, we can place constraints on the possible ways in which we could talk about a relation between brain processing and phenomenology.</section>    
    
<section>Suppose some version of PEM is right. <br> How should we understand Hohwy's bold claim that PEM can have a <span class="fragment highlight-red">direct</span> application to the <span class="fragment highlight-red">phenomenology of perception</span>?</section>    

    
<section>Take a particular example: <p>Wiese, W. (2017). Predictive Processing and the Phenomenology of Time Consciousness -
A Hierarchical Extension of Rick Grush’s Trajectory Estimation Model. In T. Metzinger &amp; W. Wiese (Eds.). Philosophy and Predictive Processing: 26. Frankfurt am Main: MIND Group.</p>

<section><h2>The Phenomenology of Time Consciousness?</h2><p class="fragment">The phenomenology of the experience of succession</p></section>  
    
    
<section>Experiencing successions of events, as with a series of notes comprising a melody, poses a puzzle. It seems that neither experiencing the different notes simultaneously nor experiencing them in sequence can give rise to the experience of succession. If we experience all notes simultaneously, we experience not a melody but a chord. If we experience first one note, then another, this is a succession of experiences, not an experience of succession (cf. James 1890). So how can we conceive of the experience of successions of events, and of temporally extended processes in general? (Wiese 2017)</section>    
    
<section>An important example derives from our experience of listening to music. When we listen to music, including when we hear a piece played for the first time, we don’t hear each note in isolation, one after the other. Rather, when we hear a note of the melody, the phenomenal character of our experience of that note is affected by the properties of the notes immediately prior to that note. This is not that surprising, and may be an effect of a kind of remembered experience affecting the character of one’s current experience. But what is surprising is that when we hear a note of the melody, the phenomenal character of our experience of that note is affected by the properties of the notes immediately after that note. So our experience of the note is affected by what is yet to come as well as what has already been. (Paul 2014)</section>  
    
<section>What you experience, rather, is, to a first approximation, the rising of the current sounds out of the past; you hear the current sounds as surging forth from the past. You hear them as a continuation. This is to say, moving on to a better approximation, you hear them as having a certain trajectory or arc, as unfolding in accordance with a definite law or pattern. It is not the past that is present in the current experience; rather, it is the trajectory or arc that is present now, and of course the arc describes the relation of what is now to what has already happened (and to what may still happen). In this way, what is present, strictly speaking, refers to or is directed toward what has happened and what will happen. (Noë 2006, p. 29, quoted by Wiese 2017, 7)</section>   
    
<section>The character of an experience at a time t is determined by the character of an experience at an earlier time t - j AND the character of an experience at a later time t + k.  <p class="fragment">Example: Cutaneous rabbit illusion (Geldard, F. A., &amp; Sherrick, C. E. (1972). </p> </section>

<section>An account of the temporal character of experience is, at least, an account of the way that the phenomenal character of an experience of succession has this structure.   <p class="fragment">In the following section, I present Wiese's take on this.</p>

<section>I am interested in Wiese's view on the relation between PEM and phenomenology  because <span class="fragment">Wiese himself sees his view as a development of Hohwy's bold claim </span><span class="fragment">and Wiese's work on  the contents of representations in PEM is, as we will later see, relevant for the discussion of the temporal structure I want to look at</span></section>        
    
<section>Wiese takes Rick Grush's Trajectory Estimate Model and adapts it to the PEM framework to form HiTEM (Hierarchy of Trajectory Estimates Model). <p class="fragment">In the following I will give a (far too quick) explanation of these models</p> </section>
    
<section>
Grush's model is a <span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="2">retentional </span> model according to which the content of an experience of succession can be described as a trajectory <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">estimate</span>, which contains estimates of what is happening at different times.
    
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"> Since estimates of what is happening at different times are computed <i>simultaneously</i>, Grush's model purportedly makes sense of what is experienced at a time as an experience of a succession.</p> </section>

<section>
    <h2>Wiese's extension</h2><p class="fragment"> To adapt  Grush's model to the PEM framework, we better talk about a hierarchy of trajectories in a feedback loop so to minimize prediction error.</p>
    <p class="fragment"> The content of [temporal experience] is not best conceived as a linear stream of events, but rather as a hierarchy of temporal wholes. (Wiese 2017, 1).</p>

    <section>What is the appropriate level of description of the phenomenological claims we started with? <p class="fragment">The <span class="fragment highlight-red">whole hierarchy</span>, <span class="fragment highlight-red">a trajectory of estimates</span> or <span class="fragment highlight-red">a subset thereof?</span></p>    </section>    

<section><h2>Not the whole hierarchy</h2>
    
    <p class="fragment">The whole hierarchy includes several levels that are plausibly not conscious. </p>
    </section>    
<section><h2>Not a subset of a trajectory</h2>
    
    <p class="fragment">A subset of a trajectory would plausibly not include the necessary range of references different times, since the whole trajectory is what captures the temporal profile of the succession.</p>
    </section>       
<section><h2>A trajectory or a subset of the hierarchy</h2>
    <p class="fragment">Which one or ones?</p>
</section>    
    
<section> 
Suppose one way of doing this: "Conscious perception is determined by the prediction or hypothesis with the hightest overall posterior probability." (Hohwy 2012) 
<p class="fragment">In the case of Wiese's HiTEM this would mean that conscious perception is determined by the trajectory (or trajectories?) with the hightest overall posterior probability.</p>   </section>    
 
<section>But if we do not pick the complete hierarchy for consciousness, we fail to capture precisely the kind of temporal relation that Wiese claims were important to introduce in the model through the different times references in different trajectories. </section>    
<section  data-background-color="white" data-background-image ="img/HiTEM2.png" data-background-size = "contain" ></section>    

<section>We fail to capture the sense in which a conscious experience of succession incorporates what we would intuively describe as past, present and future.</section>    
    
<section> 
    
Here is a plausible diagnosis of the situation 

<p class="fragment"> "The general difficulty here is one of providing an account of experience that can attribute to the subject a psychological property/state that accounts for the fact that it seems to the subject as though he is perceptually aware of an occurrence with temporal extension, while at the same time accommodating the idea that each temporal part of that occurrence seems to the subject to be concurrent with his awareness of it."(Soteriou 2010)</p>
<p class="fragment">Soteriou discusses this in the context of the debate between accounts according to which conscious sensory experiences are, most fundamentally,  mental states/events that have intentional contents with veridicality conditions and accounts according to which conscious sensory experiences are, most fundamentally, the obtaining of a distinctive kind of psychological relation of ‘acquaintance’ with material objects and their features. </p></section>    
<section>The general difficulty Wiese's model faces is one of providing an account that can attribute to the subject a psychological property/state that accounts for the fact that it seems to the subject as though he is perceptually aware of an succession, while at the same time accommodating the idea that each temporal part of that conciuoss occurrence seems to the subject to be concurrent with his awareness of it.</section>    
    
<section>The difficulty is that temporal experience ought to be construed as an experience as of features at a time N before T, at a time T and at a time M after T where these features are experienced as parts of an extended whole that covers the time from N to M. </section>
