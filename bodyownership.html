 Ordinary cases of bodily awareness like that of feeling pain in my jaw involve what seems to be a sense of ownership. When feeling pain not only do I feel pain located in a bodily part, it seems to me like it is in a part of <span class="fragment highlight-current-green ">MY</span> body.   </section>    
    
<section>For some philosophers the sense of bodily ownership is intrinsic to an awareness of the body “from the inside”, so that where there is such bodily awareness there is also an awareness as of MY body. </section>

     This, De Vignemont claims, is a case where a sensation is felt but it is not as if it were in a part of one's own body.

<section>These cases, De Vignemont argues, should not be understood as instances of indirect perception as those of being aware the mailperson is here by hearing the dog barking. 
    
<p class="fragment">
    Rather, they should be understood as cases of direct awareness, like that of being aware of the mailperson has arrived by hearing their voice. </p>    
    </section>    
    
<!--<section>Even if we grant De Vignemont's point about the direct perception in tool use, it is not clear that the evidence is problematic for the Simple view of bodily ownership.</section>    -->
    
<section>One may think that the cases of referred sensations in tools are like what O’Shaughnessy calls a transportation of appearance (2008, p. 395) where, thanks to the tool, there is a reliable transportation of what would be sensed were one in a different spatial location. </section>    
    
    <section>Just like a telescope transports the appearance of faraway objects for us to see as if they were here, we can think of canes as transporting what would be a bodily sensation we would have if our body extended as far as the tool goes. </section>    
    
    
    <section>And yet: if referred sensations are understood as an extension by transportation of our sensory capacities it is not clear that De Vignemont’s conclusion follows. </section>    
    
 <section>It is not clear that extensions of senses work just exactly like the regular, un-extended sense. An extension might ruffle-up the distinct character of our sensation and the sense of ownership might get lost.</section>

<p class="doscuadros highlightred">Subjects using a Tactile Visual Sensory Substitution (TVSS) device have extended their visual capacities by exploiting the sense of touch. And some of their perceptual reports seem to support the idea that they can recognize a range of ordinary objects, point to them in space and even tell their absolute size and distance from the subject. Some even report having a 3D sense of the environment. A good amount of what ordinary vision gives us!  </p>

</div>
</div></div>
  </section>          
    
<section>Some pain experiences of patients with somatoparaphrenia, also known as asomatognosia or alien hand syndrome, purportedly present a counterexample to the Simple view of bodily ownership for they seem to constitute cases of bodily sensation at one’s body without a sense of it being one’s own body, that is, cases of sensation without ownership.</section>    
    
<section>
    
    Many [patients] can still feel pain and even cry out if the examiner pinches their “alien” hand (Melzack, 1990). For instance, one patient asked his doctor:<br>
P: I still have the acute pain where the prosthesis is.<br>
E: Which prosthesis? <br>
P: Don’t you see? This thing here (indicating his left arm). The doctors have attached this tool to my body in order to help me to move [...] Once home could I ask my wife, from time to time, to remove this left arm and put it in the cupboard for a few hours in order to have some relief from pain? (Maravita, 2008, p. 102).<br>


    </section>    
    
<section>Subjects are aware that they feel pain at a bodily part, but they are not aware of that pain in their own body. Some report having pain in a prosthetic arm; others report feel pain in a relative’s or the examiner’s body part. 
    
    </section>  
    
<section>I do not think this philosophical gloss on the reports is obviously correct. It is not clear that the evidence shows bodily sensation in a body but not in an owned body. In the following I present a way it might rather be.</section>    
    
<section>Even though patients suffering of somatoparaphrenia have some awareness of the spatial properties of their bodily sensations they lack an awareness of other spatial properties> those of the limits. </section>   
    
<section>In ordinary cases, there is no question about why a bodily experience is perceived within certain bounds. In these cases, there is a sense that the limits of one’s bodily experience are those of one’s felt body, not merely as coinciding with one’s body but rather as constituted by it. One senses the bounds of possible experience as they are to the extente there is a sense in which the limits are set by one's own body. </section>    
    
    <section>In the case of the somatoparaphrenia, subjects lack a sense of the limits of sensation: there is no sense as to why the sensation is felt at one particular place and not, for instance, three meteres away.
</section>
    <section>
The subjects might feel pain in a location determined by the region in space occupied by their body, but they do not sense it as so. The spatial structure of their bodily sensations might be tied up to their body but is not presented as so and thus lends itself to confabulation about its ownership (“it is a prosthetic” “it is my niece’s”).  </section>
    
<section>
    
    <p class="doscuadros"> Ordinary bodily awareness is awareness of a sensation in a region of space that is sensed as part of a bigger space determined by one’s body. </p>
    </section>    
    <section>
    
    <p class="doscuadros">   Patients with somatoparaphrenia can have awareness of a sensation in a region of space that is part of a bigger space, but this space is not sensed as being part of bigger space determined by their own body.  Their sense of their body is partial, for they have no sense of the limits of possible sensation. </p>
    
  </section>    
    
<section>So> it might be possible to think that cases of pains in alien hands are not genuine bodily sensations. It is unclear. Rather, I think that they are better understood as cases where there is a limitation in their spatial sense that explains their lack of ownership.</section>    
    
<section>
    
    
De Vignemont’s purported counterexamples aim to show that there is more to the sense of ownership of one's body than sensations and their spatial properties. But I have shown that a reasonable alternative is that the cases demonstrate the rather the disassociation of ownership and some bodily spatial properties. I have argued against the plausibility of her reading of these cases by showing an alternative that leaves open the possibility of identifying the sense of ownership with a distinct form of spatial awareness.
