    Many [patients] can still feel pain and even cry out if the examiner pinches their “alien” hand (Melzack, 1990). For instance, one patient asked his doctor:<br>
P: I still have the acute pain where the prosthesis is.<br>
E: Which prosthesis? <br>
P: Don’t you see? This thing here (indicating his left arm). The doctors have attached this tool to my body in order to help me to move [...] Once home could I ask my wife, from time to time, to remove this left arm and put it in the cupboard for a few hours in order to have some relief from pain? (Maravita, 2008, p. 102).<br>

</section>    
  
<section>Some pain experiences of patients with somatoparaphrenia, also known as asomatognosia or alien hand syndrome, purportedly present a counterexample to the Simple view of bodily ownership for they seem to constitute cases of bodily sensation at one’s body without a sense of it being one’s own, that is, cases of sensation without ownership.
 <h2 class="fragment">They seem to feel pain in another person's body!?!?!</h2>
</section>  
    
<section>Subjects are aware that they feel pain at a bodily part, but they are not aware of that pain as being in their own body. Some report feeling pain in a prosthetic arm; others report feeling pain in a relative’s or the examiner’s body part. It is a pain they have in a bodily part they do not sense as if it were their own.
    
    </section>  
    
<section>But: it is not clear that the evidence shows bodily sensation with complete spatial character that is not felt to be in their own body.</section>    
    
<section>    <p class="doscuadros">
    The point: we need to tease out two aspects of spatial bodily awareness. </p>
    <p class="fragment doscuadros">
    For even though patients suffering of somatoparaphrenia have <i>some</i> awareness of the spatial properties of their bodily sensations they lack an awareness of <i>other</i> spatial properties. </p></section>   
    
<section>In ordinary cases, there is no question about why a bodily experience is perceived within certain bounds. In these cases, there is a sense that the limits of one’s bodily experience are those of one’s felt body, not merely to be the same as of one’s felt body but rather as constituted by it. One senses the bounds of possible experience as they are to the extent there is a sense in which the limits are set by one's own body. </section>    
 
   
    <section>So in ordinary cases, we have a spatial sense of the location of the sensation but also of the bounds within which those sensations could be felt. 
</section>    
    
    <section>But in the case of the somatoparaphrenia, subjects lack a sense of <span class="fragment highlight-current-green "> the limits of sensation</span><span class="fragment">: there is no sense as to why the sensation is felt at one particular place and not, for instance, three meters away</span>. 
</section>
    <section>
The subjects might feel pain in a location determined by the region in space occupied by their body, but they do not sense it as so. 
<br>
        
It is a case where the spatial structure of their bodily sensations are bound up by the sensed body but it is not presented as so, making space for confabulation about its ownership (“it is a prosthetic”, “it is my niece’s”).  </section>

Subjects with somatoparaphrenia can be said to lack a sense of ownerhip because they lack a sense of the limits of their possible bodily sensation in the alien hand.

    To conclude:
    The special character of bodily awareness as having a sole object, in contrast to the five traditional senses, is perhaps over-emphasized. 
    
    
    <p class="fragment">
    
    Though bodily awareness does not involve identifying one among many possible objects of experience, more than just the body is presented to one.  </p>
    
       <p class="fragment">
    Our bodily awareness is like simultanagnosia.One directly senses only the body, but our bodily awareness also grants us a sense of limits that is more than just what affords a sensed object.
